# Job Log - StatVision

## [2026-05-13] Cloud Staging & CI/CD Stabilization
- **Infrastructure**: Provisioned isolated Cloud Staging environment in GCP (`statsvision-477017`) using `-test` suffix for Pub/Sub and services.
- **CI/CD**: Fixed `ci.yml` and `deploy.yml` for monorepo structure. Added `workflow_dispatch` for manual control.
- **Monorepo**: Successfully stabilized `@statvision/common` as the backend source of truth.
- **Frontend**: Achieved 100% green CI run by resolving 20+ TypeScript and Linting errors (conditional hooks, type mismatches, build-time auth hydration).
- **Permissions**: Fixed GCP service account permissions for Artifact Registry and Cloud Run.
- **Deployment**: Verified successful Docker build and push logic after resolving IAM permission gaps.


## [2026-05-08] Sprint 1 Planning | Code Consolidation & Strategic Foundation
- **Attendees:** PO, SM, Dev Team, DevOps.
- **Decision:** Consolidate duplicated services (`TeamService`, `PlayerService`, `GameStatsService`) from `api` and `worker` into `common` to eliminate technical debt.
- **Decision:** Standardize the Gemini Analysis providers to use a single, shared infrastructure abstraction.
- **Sprint Goal:** Establish a clean, shared service layer and prepare for Multi-Tenancy / Temporal Roster implementation.
- **Status:** Sprint Completed. Logic consolidated into `@statvision/common`. Backend builds passing.
