# Debugging Authentication Issues: Firebase to Auth0 Migration

This document summarizes the persistent authentication token verification issues encountered and the troubleshooting steps undertaken, including the migration from Firebase to Auth0.

## The Core Problem:

The backend API is consistently rejecting authenticated requests with either an "Unauthorized: Invalid token" or a "signature verification failed" error. This indicates that the JWT (JSON Web Token) sent from the frontend is not being successfully validated by the backend's authentication middleware.

## Solutions Already Attempted:

### 1. Initial Firebase Setup & Debugging:

*   **Problem:** The backend was rejecting Firebase ID tokens with `FirebaseAuthError: Firebase ID token has invalid signature.`
*   **Attempts:
    *   Ensured `serviceAccountKey.json` was correctly placed in the `backend` directory.
    *   Updated the path to `serviceAccountKey.json` in `backend/src/app.ts`.
    *   Generated multiple fresh `serviceAccountKey.json` files from the Firebase console.
    *   Generated multiple fresh Firebase ID tokens from the frontend.
    *   Corrected the `iss` (issuer) claim mismatch by simplifying `frontend-test/src/firebase-config.js` to only export the config object.
    *   Added extensive logging to the Firebase `authMiddleware` in `backend/src/app.ts` to inspect token details and verification errors.
    *   Temporarily bypassed token verification in `authMiddleware` to confirm routes were otherwise accessible (they were, but then failed on "User not found in database" as expected).
    *   Verified system time in Termux (`date` command) to rule out time skew.
    *   Verified network connectivity from Termux to Google's Firebase public key servers (`curl -v https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com`).

### 2. Switch to Auth0 (Generic/Modular Approach):

*   **Reason for Change:** The persistent "invalid signature" error with Firebase, despite extensive debugging, led to the decision to switch to Auth0, hoping a different provider might bypass an environmental or subtle configuration issue. The goal was also to implement a more generic and modular authentication system.

*   **Backend Changes Implemented:
    *   Installed Auth0 JWT verification libraries (`express-oauth2-jwt-bearer`, `jwks-rsa`).
    *   Removed Firebase Admin SDK imports and initialization from `backend/src/app.ts`.
    *   Updated the `User` entity in `backend/src/User.ts` to use `providerUid` instead of `firebaseUid`.
    *   Created a generic `IAuthProvider` interface (`backend/src/auth/authProvider.ts`) and an `Auth0Provider` implementation (`backend/src/auth/auth0Provider.ts`).
    *   Modified `authMiddleware` in `backend/src/app.ts` to use the `Auth0Provider` for token verification.
    *   Updated all route handlers (`/register`, `/teams`, `/teams/:id`, `/teams/:teamId/players`, etc.) to use `providerUid` when interacting with the database.
    *   Updated Swagger documentation in `app.ts` to reflect the generic Auth0 authentication.
    *   Corrected a typo in `PlayerService` import path in `app.ts`.
    *   Updated PostgreSQL username and password in `AppDataSource` to `statsvision`.
    *   Added logging for troubleshooting within `Auth0Provider`, including the incoming token's `kid`.

*   **Frontend Changes Implemented:
    *   Uninstalled `firebase` and installed `@auth0/auth0-react`.
    *   Cleaned `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` to resolve peer dependency conflicts.
    *   Removed Firebase imports and initialization from `frontend-test/src/index.tsx` and `frontend-test/src/App.tsx`.
    *   Configured `Auth0Provider` in `frontend-test/src/index.tsx` with Auth0 Domain and Audience.
    *   Updated `frontend-test/src/App.tsx` to use Auth0 hooks (`useAuth0`), implement login/logout via Auth0, display the Auth0 Access Token with a copy button, and update cURL command placeholders.
    *   Added a "Register with Auth0" button to the frontend.

*   **Auth0-Specific Errors & Debugging Attempts:
    *   **`unauthorized_client: Callback URL mismatch`:** Resolved by manually adding `http://localhost:5173` to Auth0's "Allowed Callback URLs" in the dashboard.
    *   **`Error: Service not found: EwznPDvrgImiuHRP45HbapAwGToc4tqM`:** Resolved by correctly configuring the Auth0 API Audience to `basetball-analyzer` (which is the Identifier of the created Auth0 API) instead of the Client ID.
    *   **Current Persistent Error: `{"message":"signature verification failed"}`:** The backend's `express-oauth2-jwt-bearer` middleware is failing to verify the token's signature. The logs show `Auth0Provider: Incoming Token KID: M9F8Fjg4izEHT8LjStJaj`, but the middleware cannot verify it against the public keys. This points to a fundamental mismatch or issue with the Auth0 API's signing keys or their availability via the JWKS endpoint.
    *   Verified network connectivity from Termux to Auth0's JWKS endpoint (`curl -v https://dev-3os8m0zyfxmx60nn.us.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json`) â€“ it succeeded.
    *   Checked (and removed) `allowMultiAudiences: true` as it was an invalid configuration option.
    *   Added logging for `kid` from the token header and `Auth0Provider` error details to pinpoint the exact failure.

### 3. Resolution of `req.user` Population Issue

**The Mistake:**
The core mistake stemmed from a misunderstanding of how the `express-jwt` middleware populates the `req` object after successfully verifying a JSON Web Token (JWT).

**Developer's Assumption (and my initial assumption):**
The assumption was that `express-jwt`, upon successful verification of a JWT, would attach the decoded payload to a nested `payload` property within `req.auth`. That is, the developer expected to access the JWT claims (like `sub` for user ID and `email`) via `req.auth.payload.sub` and `req.auth.payload.email`. This assumption was reflected in the initial TypeScript `declare global` block for `Express.Request.auth`:

```typescript
declare global {
  namespace Express {
    interface Request {
      auth?: {
        payload: { // Assumed payload would be nested here
          sub: string;
          email?: string;
          [key: string]: any;
        };
      };
    }
  }
}
```

**Actual Behavior of `express-jwt`:**
In reality, `express-jwt` (and similar JWT middleware) directly assigns the *decoded JWT payload* to the `req.auth` property. This means `req.auth` itself *is* the payload object, containing claims like `sub`, `email`, `aud`, `iss`, etc., directly as its properties.

**The Discrepancy and its Impact:**
Because the code was looking for `req.auth.payload`, and `req.auth.payload` did not exist (as the payload was directly on `req.auth`), the conditional check `if (req.auth && req.auth.payload)` always evaluated to `false`.

This had several critical consequences:

1.  **`req.user` Not Populated**: The code block responsible for extracting `uid` and `email` from the payload and assigning them to `req.user` was never executed. Consequently, `req.user` remained `undefined`.
2.  **Authentication Middleware Failure**: The `authMiddleware` relies on `req.user` being populated to identify the authenticated user and to perform the database lookup/creation logic. Since `req.user` was `undefined`, the middleware could not proceed with user identification or creation.
3.  **401 Unauthorized Errors**: Without a recognized authenticated user, all requests to protected backend routes resulted in a 401 Unauthorized error.
4.  **User Creation Failure**: The logic to create a new user in the database if they didn't exist was never reached, as it depended on `req.user` being populated.

**The Fix:**
The solution involved two main steps to align the code with the actual behavior of `express-jwt`:

1.  **Correcting Type Definitions**: The `declare global` block for `Express.Request.auth` was updated to reflect that `req.auth` directly holds the payload properties (`sub`, `email`, etc.), rather than nesting them under a `payload` property.
2.  **Correcting Code Access**: The code in `Auth0Provider.verifyToken` was changed to access the claims directly from `req.auth` (e.g., `req.auth.sub`, `req.auth.email`) instead of `req.auth.payload.sub` and `req.auth.payload.email`.

By making these corrections, `req.user` is now correctly populated after JWT verification, allowing the authentication middleware to function as intended, identify the user, and proceed with the request or create the user in the database if necessary.
